* Setup
- Open a terminal
- Clone the repository: =git clone git@github.com:Eurydice86/webpage.git=
- Change the working directory: =cd webpage=
- Create a virtual environment: =python -m venv .venv=
- Activate the environment: =source .venv/bin/activate=

* Updates
The info displayed is updated from MyClub and the EHMS website.
The script =connection_and_last_run_time_check.sh= checks for an available internet connection; if it finds one, it updates the information every 12 hours, and saves it to local files, so that the info can be displayed even if there is no connection available. It also runs =git pull= to get the latest version of the scripts, in case there have been modifications.

* Scheduling
In order to run the script periodically, create a cron job on the machine that runs the aforementioned script: =*/5 * * * * /home/ehms/webpage/connection_and_last_run_time_check.sh=

* Maintenance
Remember to keep the machine up to date (=sudo apt update=, followed by =sudo apt upgrade= every once in a while)

- Activate the virtual environment: =source .venv/bin/activate=
